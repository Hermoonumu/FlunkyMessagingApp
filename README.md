# 📮 Messaging app with ASP.NET Core Web API
Can you even call it an app if it is a lone API?

## 🎯 Goal of this thingamajig I'm trying to build
- Practice C#
- Get gist of EF and Fluent API (I FRIGGING HATE IT)
- Try my hand in Auth (JWT)
- MAYBE build frontend (Decoupled of course for it is only api)
- Add more stuff as I progress (hopefully)

## ☑️ What's been achieved?
- All models that are essential for operation
- Actual reactive frontend with Angular 20
- Chatting between users (both API and UI Angular)
- Filtering messages by already read and not read, as well as all the messages
- JWT Auth (access tokens, refresh tokens, refreshing both tokens in front)
- Made relations between them (1:N User-Msgs) (damned fluent api)
- Like actually existing endpoints (registration, login and auth test for now)
- Realtime chatting
- Some very basic logging (NOT THREAD SAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) (because I implemented it lol)

## 🚲 What's to do?
- I did everything I could

## ¿ So ehhh
if you know c# and dis kinda stuff get me some halp
