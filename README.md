# 📮 Messaging app with ASP.NET Core Web API
Can you even call it an app if it is a lone API?

## 🎯 Goal of this thingamajig I'm trying to build
- Practice C#
- Get gist of EF and Fluent API (I FRIGGING HATE IT)
- Try my hand in Auth (JWT)
- MAYBE build frontend (Decoupled of course for it is only api)
- Add more stuff as I progress (hopefully)

## ☑️ What's been achieved?
- A few models (Message, User)
- JWT Auth (access tokens, refresh tokens to be done yet)
- Made relations between them (1:N User-Msgs) (damned fluent api)
- Like actually existing endpoints (registration, login and auth test for now)

## 🚲 What's to do?
- More models
- Controllers
- Services
- you name it

## ¿ So ehhh
if you know c# and dis kinda stuff get me some halp
